/*Manually compile tests with TypeScript
Sometimes, Playwright Test will not be able to transform your TypeScript code correctly, for example when you are using experimental or very recent features of TypeScript, usually configured in tsconfig.json.
In this case, you can perform your own TypeScript compilation before sending the tests to Playwright.
First add a tsconfig.json file inside the tests directory:
*/
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ESNext",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "moduleResolution": "Node",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "outDir": "../tests-out",
    }
}
