//get by placeholder
await page.getByPlaceholder('Enter your email').fill('manh+edu1@gotitapp.co');
await page.getByPlaceholder('Enter your email').press('Tab');
//get by locator
await page.locator(`input[placeholder='Enter your password']`).fill('Aa123456@');
//click by css selector
// await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log In' }).first().click();
//click by text
await page.click("'Log in'");
await expect(page.getByRole('main')).toContainText('Manage your courses and students, all in one place!');

newContext() = not shared cookie
const newContext = await browser.newContext();
const newPage = await newContext.newPage();
await newPage.goto("/home");
await page.waitForTimeout(15000);

### 1. Playwright Test Generator and Test Inspector

‚Äìnpx playwright codegen

### 2. Playwright Fixtures

- we don‚Äôt need to launch a Chromium browser; instead, we place a code that indicates ‚Äò‚Äôpage. goto along with the URL.‚Äô‚Äô
- In short, we can say that there is the usage of only parameters under the Playwright test runner, and this concept is known as the Playwright fixture.
- under the test file folder, we are using the fixture page, we open the browser and, in the end, close the browser.
- browser's opening and closing happen alone, and we do not have to make manual changes

### 3. Screenshots And Videos On Test Failures

use: {
//work - but not show correct screenshot name
screenshot: 'on',
///work - but not show correct video name
video: {
mode: 'on',
// mode:'retain-on-failure',//prefer this to reduce report size
size: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
}
}

## III. Playwright Component Testing: How To Get Started

https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/playwright-component-testing

1. Installing React
   sudo npx create-react-app myappname (no capital letters)
2. Project Structure
3. Start the app
   cd component-app
   sudo npm start
   back to terminal of the componennt-app
4. Installing Playwright Components Module
   sudo npm init playwright@latest -- --ct
   ‚úî Success! Created a Playwright Test project at /Users/manhkaka
   Downloads/automation-tut/component-app
   Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
   npm run test-ct
   Runs the component tests.
   npm run test-ct -- --project=chromium
   Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.
   npm run test-ct App.test.ts
   Runs the tests in the specific file.
   npm run test-ct -- --debug
   Runs the tests in debug mode.
   We suggest that you begin by typing:
   npm run test-ct
   Visit https://playwright.dev/docs/intro for more information. ‚ú®
   Happy hacking! üé≠

5. Playwright Component Structure
   playwright: A new folder has been created; it contains two files.
   index.html: This file will be used by Playwright to mount your component, and it will do it in the same way as React > Public > index.html by using the ‚Äúroot‚Äù element.
   index.ts: This file is for you to include themes, styles, or even apply code for the page where your component will be mounted.
   playwright-ct.config.ts: The playwright configuration file where you can set up your browser, timeouts, etc.
6. Creating the Test File
   create a tests folder inside src folder
   create components.spec.tsx
7. Writing the Test
   7.1 Allowing JSX
   //allowing us to write HTML in React
   create a tsconfig.json file
   {
   "compilerOptions": {
   "jsx": "react-jsx",
   "target": "ESNext",
   "module": "commonjs",
   "moduleResolution": "Node",
   "sourceMap": true,
   "outDir": "../tests-out"
   }
   }
8. Understanding the Test
   ‚Äúmount‚Äù basically allows us to put the component into the DOM to render it

9. Running the Test
   npm run test-ct
   Note:

- App.test.js file might not work
- You can change test dir: testDir: './src/tests', in playwright-ct.config.ts

10. Adding more Components to App

- create header.js in src with below code
  function Header () {
  return (
  <header>
  <h1>Header Testing Component</h1>
  </header>
  )
  }
  export default Header
- in App.js, update
  import Header from './header'
  function App() {
  return (
  <div className="App">
  <Header/>
  <header className="App-header">
  {/_ add an attribute called ‚Äúqa-id‚Äù to the header component _/}
  <h1 qa-id="header-component">Header Text in Testing Component</h1>

11. Updating the Test
    in components.spec.tsx
    test('should work', async ({ mount, page }) => {
    const component = await mount(<App></App>);
    await expect(component).toContainText('Learn React');
    await expect(page.locator("[qa-id='header-component']")).toHaveText("Header Text in Testing Component")
      <!-- page.close() -->

    await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
    });

12. Testing Header Component in Isolation

- in App.js
  import Header from '../../src/header';
  // import App from '../../src/App'
  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';
  import Header from '../../src/header';
  test.use({ viewport: { width: 500, height: 500 } });

test('should work', async ({ mount, page }) => {
const component = await mount(<Header></Header>);
await expect(page.locator("[qa-id='Header']")).toHaveText("Header Testing Component")
page.close()
});

13. Visual Testing of Components

- step 1: add below code
  await expect(page.locator("header>h1")).toHaveScreenshot()
- step 2: run 2 times "npm run test-ct"
  //first run to take screenshot
  //second run to compare screenshot for visual testing

14. Other notes
    //Keep in mind the script in the package.json file will also need to be added for you to execute the tests.
    "test-ct": "playwright test -c playwright-ct.config.ts"

## IX. Playwright Assertions : Complete Guide With Examples

https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/playwright-assertions
https://github.com/codewithmmak/playwright-assertions-demo

- expect
- Negative Matchers
  eg: await expect(page.getByText('Top Category'), 'top category text should not be visible').not.toBeVisible();
- Soft Assertions and Hard Assertions
  eg: Soft Assertions just verifying some condition, and it doesn‚Äôt interrupt the whole execution if the condition is not satisfied but marks the test as failed
  const { test } = require("../lambdatest-setup");
  const { expect } = require("@playwright/test");
  test('Soft assertion test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io');
  //soft
  await expect.soft(page.getByText('Top Category'), 'top category should be visible').toBeVisible();
  //hard
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Your Store");
  });
- Default intervals are [100, 250, 500, 1000].
  test('Custom Polling test', async ({ page }) => {
  await expect.poll(async () => {
  const response = await page.request.get('https://api.lambdatest.com/automation/api/v1/platforms');
  return response.status();
  }, {
  message: 'Response was either not 200 or timeout',
  intervals: [2_000, 4_000, 10_000],
  timeout: 20000,
  }).toBe(201);//201 to mimic failure, status should be 200
  });

## 13. Playwright Page Object Model: A Definitive Guide
https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/playwright-page-object-model
https://github.com/qa-gary-parker/playwright-testing-pom

The ‚Äòtests‚Äô folder contains all of our spec files
The ‚Äòpages‚Äô folder contains the corresponding page files in line with our spec files
You will also notice we have a ‚Äòbase.page.js‚Äô; this is optional and can be used to store any global actions which are not isolated to a single component or page
Outside this folder structure, we have the usual package, config, and module files
We may want to add ‚Äòutilities‚Äô, ‚Äòconfig‚Äô or additional ‚Äòhelper‚Äô folders as the project grows, but this is all we need as a starting point

### 12.1. Page class design structures
1. option 1
//registerPage.ts
import { Page, Locator } from "@playwright/test";
export default class RegisterPage {
    constructor(public page: Page) { }
    get firstNameInput(): Locator { 
      return this.page.locator("#input-firstname"); 
   }
}
//testcase.test.ts
import { test, expect } from './your_test_config_file'; // replace with your test config file
import RegisterPage from './registerPage';

let registerPage: RegisterPage;

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
   registerPage = new RegisterPage(page);
});

test('register test', async ({ page }) => {
   await registerPage.firstNameInput.type('John');
});

2. option 2
//registerPage.ts
import { Page } from "@playwright/test";
export default class RegisterPage {
    constructor(public page: Page) { }

    async enterFirstName(firstname: string) {
        await this.page.locator("#input-firstname")
            .type(firstname);
    }
});

//testcase.test.ts
test.describe("Page object test demo", async () => {
    let register: any;

    test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
        register = new RegisterPage(page);
    });

    test("TC1: Register test_01", async ({ page, baseURL }, testInfo) => {
        await page.goto(`${baseURL}route=account/register`);
        await register.enterFirstName(firstName);
});
});
### 12.2. Test case design structures
1. option 1
test.describe("Page object test demo", async () => {
   let register: any;
   test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
      register = new RegisterPage(page);
   });
   test("Register test_01", async ({ page, baseURL }, testInfo) => {
      await page.goto(`${baseURL}route=account/register`);
   });
});

### 14.2. Implementing visual testing for a single element
Before we perform Playwright visual regression testing, we will need to update our baseline images. We can do that by running this simple command:
npx playwright test --update-snapshots

### 14.3. Working with Thresholds
With Playwright visual regression testing, as with any type of automation testing, there will always be a margin for error. This is where thresholds come in useful. We can adjust and manage various threshold types depending on our application and use case.

Here are three examples below:

- maxDiffPixelRatio - this value can be between 0 and 1 and is defined as the acceptable amount of pixels that can differ from the total amount of pixels.
- maxDiffPixels - this can be any value and is just a count of how many pixels can be different - it's worth experimenting with your test execution and seeing what an acceptable difference is.
- Threshold - this value can be between 0 (strict) and 1 (lax) and is the acceptable perceived color difference between the same pixel in the compared images - again, this is worth experimenting with and seeing how strict you want it to be.

This can be applied globally to all tests or just to a specific project.

module.exports = {
expect: {
toHaveScreenshot: { maxDiffPixels: 100 },
},
};

### 14.4. Ignoring sections of the webpage during comparison
- use an option called ‚Äòmask,‚Äô which allows us to ignore a locator or group of locators from our comparison
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
// example.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');


test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto('https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/');
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({mask: [page.locator('.carousel-inner')]})
});

### 14.5. Implementing full page visual comparisons
- this will capture the full height of the webpage. This can be useful if your website has a lot of scrollable components or content you need to verify.
- we capture a larger area, the chance of failure may be higher. We can reduce this risk by using a few additional parameters.
   + animations: ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù - this will stop any CSS animations or transitions on your webpage.
   + maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.2 - which we covered earlier, will allow some room for minor differences.
// example.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto('https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/');
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot
({ fullPage: true, animations: "disabled", maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.2 });
});
